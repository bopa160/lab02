# Lab 02 -- Chapter 01

## Define the following terms:

* Object- State or behavior (instance) of a class
* 
* Class- a blueprint (code) that defines how to create an object.
* 
* Instance- a specific realization of any object.
* 
* method- a collection of statements, within a class, used to manipulate (mutators) or access (accessors) infomation from an object. (behaves like a function in math) 
* 
* signature- the name of the method and the type of parameter. Ex. the foolowing signature changes the size of the instance 'box' of class   [void change Size(Box box)]
* 
* parameter- an input of the method. I.e. 'box' is the parameter in the example above.
* 
* type- defines what values the parameter is allowed to be.
* 
* state- set of values decribing a object.
* 
* source code- Colection of written commands that compiles to created an executable program.
* 
* return value- enable us to get information from a object via a method call. (output of a method)
* 
* compiler- translates the source code into computer language. (forces the computer to read the instructions).

## In Chapter 1 we have mentioned the data types int and String. Java has more predefined data types. Find out what they are and what they are used for. To do this, you can check Appendix B, or look it up in another Java book or in an online Java language manual. One such manual is at [http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)

## What are the types of the following values?

* 0: byte
* "hello": char
* 101: int
* -1: int
* true: boolean value
* "33": char
* 3.1415: float

## What would you have to do to add a new field, for example one called name, to a circle object?
I would have to add private String name to the source code.

## Write the header for a method named send that has one parameter of type String, and does not return a value.
public void Send (String circle)

## Write the header for a method named average that has two parameters, both of type int, and returns an int value.
public void int average (int firstInt, int secondInt)

## Look at the book you are reading right now. Is it an object or a class? If it is a class, name some objects. If it is an object, name its class. 
The textbook I am reading is a object. Its class would be book.

## Can an object have several different classes? Discuss.
An object can belong to multiple classes. One of these such objects are books. Books can belong to the class of novels. They can also belong to the reference class.
