# Lab 02 -- Chapter 01

## Define the following terms:
* Object- All classes that have no obvious superclass. Java objects model objects from a problem domain
* Class- describes the kind of objects represent instances of the class. A class name can be used as the type for a variable. Variables that have a class as their type can store objects of that class.
* Instance- objects of a particular class
* method- a procedure associated with an object
* signature-  used to provide applications the functionality of a digital signature algorithm.
* parameter- a special kind of variable, used in a subroutine to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the subroutine.
* type- the common superinterface for all types in the programming language. 
* state- defined by the attributes of the object and by the values these have.
* source code- a text listing of commands to be compiled or assembled into an executable computer program.
* return value- enable us to get information from a object via a method call.
* compiler- translates the code into machine code.

## In Chapter 1 we have mentioned the data types int and String. Java has more predefined data types. Find out what they are and what they are used for. To do this, you can check Appendix B, or look it up in another Java book or in an online Java language manual. One such manual is at [http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)

## What are the types of the following values?

* 0: byte
* "hello": char
* 101: int
* -1: int
* true: boolean value
* "33": char
* 3.1415: float

## What would you have to do to add a new field, for example one called name, to a circle object?


## Write the header for a method named send that has one parameter of type String, and does not return a value.

## Write the header for a method named average that has two parameters, both of type int, and returns an int value.

## Look at the book you are reading right now. Is it an object or a class? If it is a class, name some objects. If it is an object, name its class.

## Can an object have several different classes? Discuss.
